# password-manager
A simple python based password manager. To use it, simply input the website the account is on, the E-mail and the password (Or generate a random safe password with the built-in generator) and save. The app saves the password to a local json file, which it creates after the first password is saved.
You can also search for previously saved passwords, just input the website you want a password for and click search.
